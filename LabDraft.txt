#Add Event Listeners to DOM elements

* Must export components from 'EyesOnMe.js' and 'Keypad.js

* Will use <input type="password" /> to capture input.


1. Create a "Keypad" commponent, render an 'input' of the right type.
    'input' will have a 'change' event listener that prints "Entering password..." when triggered.

2. Create an "EyesOnMe" component, render a "button" with text "Eyes on me"
    add "focus" and "blur" event handlers to the button.
    on "focus", print "Good!"
    on "blur", print "Hey! Eyes on me!"
